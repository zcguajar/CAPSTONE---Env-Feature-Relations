# CAPSTONE---Env-Feature-Relations

Hello! This is a repo that will contain all of our model testing from here on out. So far we have included the initial four linear regression demons. 
The code included currently trains Humidity specifically, as that is the presentation file, but commented throughout the rest of the file is code that trains Temperature, pH, and rainfall.
More tests are in the works!
